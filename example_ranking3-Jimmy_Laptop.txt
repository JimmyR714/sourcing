Evaluating these companies requires assessing them against the given criteria. Since detailed background information on each company's founder(s), investment history, and recent financial performance is not provided within the query, the evaluation will rely heavily on the information implicitly suggested within the company descriptions and their relevance to AI agent frameworks and AI agent developer tool startups. Here's a reasoned approach to the selection based on the provided criteria:

1. **Relevance to AI agents and development tools:** Companies explicitly stating their focus on AI agents, frameworks, development tools, or platforms explicitly useful for AI agent development are prioritized.

2. **Founders based in the US:** Without specific details on founders, we can't directly apply this criterion, but companies with a strong US presence or market might indirectly suggest US-based founders.

3. **Founders with degrees from top-tier universities:** Assuming companies focused on cutting-edge technology or with significant technical complexity might have founders with strong academic backgrounds.

4. **Founders previously employed by top-tier companies:** Companies with advanced technological solutions may imply founders or leadership teams have prior top-tier company experience.

5. **Previous entrepreneurial success:** Startups with significant advancements or recognitions may hint at experienced founders.

6. **Recent financial improvement:** Not directly assessable without financial data.

7. **Top-tier investors:** Without specific investment information, we can only speculate based on the company's advancements and partnerships, which might hint at strong backing.

Based on these considerations, selections will focus on companies that mention AI agents or development tools explicitly, suggest innovation, and hint at robust frameworks or platforms that would attract interest from experienced technologists and possibly top-tier investors. Here are picks reflecting these principles:

1. **487 - SynthFlow AI:** Focused on building AI agents at scale, strongly aligns with the query's interest in frameworks and developer tools.

2. **329 - Stack AI:** Offers a no-code platform tailored for AI development, which is directly relevant to AI agent development.

3. **181 - One AI:** An API-first language AI service, demonstrating a robust infrastructure that could be foundational for AI agent frameworks.

4. **256 - NinjaTech AI:** Claims to be the world's first Performance AI Optimization platform, suggesting technological advancement and potential top-tier technical leadership.

5. **135 - Leap AI:** Emphasizes quick, powerful AI workflow building, aligning well with the development tool aspect of the query.

6. **889 - Alan AI:** A SaaS platform for enterprises to build AI agents, directly meeting the query's focus.

7. **767 - Berri AI:** While its focus is on SaaS API platforms, the inclusion of AI development tools is likely, aligning with the criteria.

8. **685 - Iterate.ai:** Described as an Enterprise AI platform encouraging big dreams and innovation, implying a strong foundation and relevance.

9. **896 - ThirdAI:** Described as cutting-edge, which might indicate innovative approaches and the presence of founders with strong backgrounds.

10. **540 - Glyphic AI:** Focusing on intuitive product insights through AI, suggesting a technical sophistication that matches our criteria for advanced development tools.

This selection process weighs heavily on the explicit mention of AI tools, frameworks, and services directly relevant to AI agent development, along with implied innovation and technological advancement:
